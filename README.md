# Welcome to my public Hubitat repository

Some things here are unfinished. Unless it is posted as a [RELEASE] on the forum. But most things here are stuff that I personally use. I post here when I have stuff working for me. Feel free to use anything you find here. I figure at least it may spark an idea in someone else.


For my official releases .. follow me on the Hubitat Community forums: [https://community.hubitat.com/u/bcopeland](https://community.hubitat.com/u/bcopeland?u=bcopeland)
